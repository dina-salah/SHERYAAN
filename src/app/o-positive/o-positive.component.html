    <h1>O POSITIVE</h1>
    <ul class="container">
        <li>Type O positive blood is given to patients more than any other blood type,
            which is why it's considered the most needed blood type.</li>
        <li>38% of the population has O positive blood, making it the most common blood type.</li>
        <li>O positive red blood cells are not universally compatible to all types, but they
            are compatible to any red blood cells that are positive (A+, B+, O+, AB+).</li>
        <li>Over 80% of the population has a positive blood type and can receive O positive blood.
            That's another reason it's in such high demand.</li>
        <li>O positive donors who are CMV negative are known as Heroes for Babies at the Red Cross because
            it is the safest blood for transfusions for immune deficient newborns.</li>
        <li>In major traumas with massive blood loss, many hospitals transfuse O positive blood,
            even when the patient's blood type is unknown. The risk of reaction is much lower in ongoing
            blood loss situations and O positive is more available than O negative. Type O positive blood is
            critical in trauma care.</li>
        <li>Those with O positive blood can only receive transfusions from O positive or O negative blood types.</li>
        <li>Type O positive blood is one of the first to run out during a shortage due to its high demand. </li>
