    <p style="font-size: 25px; color: rgb(77, 76, 76);">Donating blood is a humanitarian gesture and more people are being well aware of the need for it by each passing year. 
        It is good social work as it indicates that people are getting more sensible towards the sufferings of others. According to a report by the World Health Organization (WHO), 
        around 117.4 million blood donations are collected globally. Anyone who is willing to donate blood can approach these blood banks, where they will be guided further by a medical professional. Hospitals and Non-government Organizations also organize
        blood donation camps from time to time.</p><br><br>
